# Getting Started with Think Fast Backend

## How to use:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install && npm run start`

The app is listening on port 3001


### Notes:

For ease of setup of the MVP version
we use nodejs json db - https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-json-db \
which does not require any setup steps, other than installing the package.

On future versions, we could upgrade to a more scalable database \
such as mongodb, without making any changes to the client side
